mtcars is a classic tidyverse dataset of fuel consumption and other aspects for 32 cars of different models.  
We selected only cars that had an mpg of under 20. We wanted to look specifically at the variables mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and gears. The mtcars_mpg2 dataframe is the reduced df.
